# NativeCrypto

**A simple cryptocurrency tracker app with React Native.**

This is my very first app with React Native. I welcome criticisms (via issues)
and code refactoring (via pull requests) but if you want to add a feature or
change the UI/UX please do so in your own fork.

I will not publish this application to any store, I won't and can't really stop
you doing so but be aware that I decline all responsibility and will not patch
nor update this app regularly.

## Preview on your devise

You can preview the app on your Android or iOS devise through the Expo app
([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
or [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/expo-client/id982107779)).
Within the app scan the following QR code :
